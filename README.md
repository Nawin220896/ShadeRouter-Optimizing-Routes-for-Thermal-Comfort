## ‚ú® Abstract
ShadeRouter is a novel route planning system designed to address the growing concerns of heat exposure in metropolitan areas, especially for cyclists and pedestrians. The system integrates shaded areas into a multi-layered road graph using advanced segmentation models applied to high-resolution satellite images. By leveraging a modified Dijkstra algorithm, ShadeRouter enables users to customize their routes based on a balance of distance and shade coverage. Preliminary tests in Tempe, Arizona, demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing outdoor comfort and promoting sustainable urban mobility.
